# surfs_up
## Project Overview
Analysis done to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The main goal was to provide insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu by generating summary statistics of the temperature for the months of June and Dicember from 2010 to 2017. This statistics will help the investors determine if this location is a good fit for their busines. 

The analysis was donde by writing queries that filtered the desired data, converting those queries to a list and then to a DataFrame. After the DataFrame was created I used .describe() to calculate the summary statistics to present to the investors.

## Resources
- Data source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy.
